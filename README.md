Another basic game created using vanilla JS.

In this game, there are two players who take turns rolling a die. 
Each round, one player can roll the dice, if they roll a "1", their turn is over. 
However, the player can choose to end their turn and take their points instead of risking rolling a 1 and losing their points for that turn. 

First player to 100 points wins!
